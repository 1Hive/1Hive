How to do stuff in the 1Hive DAO if you're a BEE

<br>

Things to cover:
- adding HONEY to Metamask
- voting
- requesting permissions from Aragon apps

<br>

## Adding HONEY to Metamask üçØü¶ä

TBD. I don't have any HONEY yet so I can't do this.

## Voting

Votes are how 1Hive makes decisions. Votes can also be used to ask a question and get feedback from the hive. In this section we'll explore how to do that using the BEE and HONEY voting apps.

### Opening the Voting app

To open the voting app, [open the 1Hive DAO](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/0xe520428C232F6Da6f694b121181f907931fD2211), click on the Voting app on the left side menubar, and select the app you'd like to use (BEE or HONEY). This will display all the open and past votes for that token in the main window. 

Note: BEE token votes are different from HONEY token votes. Participation in either is limited to accounts that hold that token. 

### Creating a new signalling vote

To create a new vote, open the voting app and click on the New Vote button in the top right section of the main window. This will allow you to ask a yes/no question to the group. Type your question into the box, click begin question, click create transaction, and pay the tx fee to confirm it and add it to the DAO. People can then vote yay or nay on this question. This is useful for gathering sentiment on how the community feels about something, or to inform decisions that cannot be enforced via code. 

### Creating other types of votes

Many actions within the DAO require a vote. To see all the actions whos permissions are tied to the voting app, click on the Permissions app on the left sidebar, then click on each app to see the permissions. You'll see the permissions that have been set on the app under "Permissions set on this app".

To actually create a vote to do stuff with these apps you'll have to go to the app and select the action you want to take. This will create a vote, and once you confirm a tx to add it to the DAO, that action will be available for BEE or HONEY token holders to vote on. This is required for things like changing permissions in the org, reqesting tokens, and almost everything else.
