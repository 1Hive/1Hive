### Chat Etiquette

We love our community chat and find it incredibly helpful when coordinating with other community members, but there are many ways for chats to go wrong. Please try and adopt the following behaviors when participating in 1Hive chat.

- Always keep to the purpose of the group! Avoid sharing irrelevant messages about other topics.
- Keep conversations civil, and try and keep a positive tone.
- If you’re lurking in a group chat and ‘seeing’ every message, occasionally respond with *something*, even if its just a reaction emoji.
- Do not spam the group!
