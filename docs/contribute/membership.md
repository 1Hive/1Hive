After joining keybase and becoming an established community member individuals can request formal membership in the 1Hive organization that is currently [deployed on mainnet](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/beehive). All new members must be voted in by existing members.

Formal members are identified by a non-transferable `Bee` token, which grants them various rights related to the governance of the 1Hive organization.

To request membership simply ask an existing member in the keybase chat, and they can create a vote to mint you a `Bee` token.


### Membership guidelines

- Members are expected to remain actively engaged and are **required** to participate in governance decisions.

- If a member becomes inactive, the remaining members should vote to remove them.

- Members are responsible for minting and budgeting `Honey`, a separate transferable token issued by the organization.

### Why `Honey`?

- `Honey` is used to coordinate contributions.

- Members can earn `Honey` by contributing to 1Hive *projects*, by being nominated for a *community allocation*, or (in the future) by being added to *payroll*.

- `Honey` is used to govern the organizations treasury and is *redeemable* for a proportional share of treasury assets.
