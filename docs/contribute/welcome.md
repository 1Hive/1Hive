1Hive is a [decentralized autonomous organization](docs/wiki/guides/daos) working to grow the open source commons by contributing to research, development, and documentation related to open source sustainability.  

We believe that improving how we collaborate and recognize contributions to open source communities will help grow the open source software commons. We also believe that advocating for an abundant open source software commons is the best way to mitigate social risks associated with the broad integration of technology into our economic systems and societies.

We see incredible potential in **decentralized autonomous organizations** to improve how we govern open source projects and track and reward contributors, despite the ecosystem and tools still being very much in their infancy. By using an Aragon organization on a daily basis to organize our community, we are able to benefit from a strong feedback loop between our experiences and our contributions.

We recognize that the biggest challenge in expanding the open source software commons is in finding ways to adequately fund the efforts of open source contributors. This sparked the idea for [Apiary](https://github.com/1hive/apairy), a bonding curve based crowdfunding mechanism for DAOs. It is also the underlying motivation behind the [commons license](https://github.com/1Hive/commons-license), which we are currently exploring as the foundation of a more sustainable open source software licensing model.

We are documenting our processes here in order to help new community members get involved and up to speed on how we work together. However, the guide is also intended to be used as a template for other open source communities to adopt and remix. Our process is an ongoing experiment that is continuously evolving as we learn and improve! 

If you find anything unclear, please [join our keybase](keybase) and ask us or [open an issue](https://github.com/1Hive/website/issues) so that we can help!
