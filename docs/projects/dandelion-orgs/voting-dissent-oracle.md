The Voting Dissent Oracle is implemented as an enhanced version of Aragon One's voting app which allows an organization to restrict actions based on whether an address has recently voted `Yes`.

## Status

The Voting with Dissent Oracle app is still under development. If you are interested in contributing please review our [open issues](https://github.com/1hive/delay-app/issues).
