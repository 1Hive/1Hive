## General Notes and Sketches

### 1Hive "thesis"

1Hive is a community-driven organization working to improve open source sustainability and grow the open source commons. We believe that software-defined organizations can help open source projects better attract patrons and reward contributors and maintainers for their work.

We are also keenly aware that while Aragon is currently a leader in software-defined organization infrastructure, there is still much work to be done to reach a point where the technology is broadly accessible to a mainstream audience outside of those who have already been indoctrinated into the crypto ecosystem.

We have a specific target user and use case in mind for Aragon, and to support those users we believe that participating in an Aragon org should feel more like joining a community on a web2 social network like Github or Reddit rather than bootstrapping a crypto-native start-up. They should be able to login and get started interacting without downloading apps or extensions immediately, they should be able to load pages instantly, and they should not have to worry about micro-transactions every time they click a button.

### Flora, a less decentralized but more efficient alternative to Ethereum mainnet

We believe that deploying an organization to Ethereum mainnet is a good option for a specific subset of organizations which want to interact with lots of external applications, or desire sovereign grade censorship resistance. However, we think that there is a strong case to be made that the vast majority of users who would benefit from Aragon do not need these features and would benefit greatly from deploying on a sidechain with less congestion, lower transaction fees, and faster confirmation times.

We will deploy and maintain a sidechain and maintain the core Aragon infrastructure there. This sidechain will also introduce a novel Discount Token mechanism based on research done by BlockScience. The discount token model used on Flora will enable regular users to become co-owners and operators of the network and grant governance rights over the validator set. But more importantly, it will enable them to purchase and hold tokens to cover their usage and then not need to worry about the mental overhead of micro-transactions if they don’t want to. The discount token, Honey, will be issued by 1Hive’s Aragon organization on Ethereum mainnet and linked to ANT via Aragon Fundraising.

The Aragon community is talking about go-to-market strategies. Flora, a scalable Araogn sidechain could help a lot with this. If 1Hive rolls out an Aragon sidechain, then Aragon will be able to offer both sovereign censorship resistant DAOs and/or fast, cheap, and scalable DAOs. This will greatly increase the pool of talent Aragon can attract, It will also allow Aragon to compete with platforms that will be launches on "next gen" smart contract platforms that are cheaper and faster than Ethereum.  Overall this will lower the barriers to entry for developers and new organizations building on Aragon.

### Iterative Security Upgrades

Just like burner wallet allows users to get started right away, and gradually increase their security, Flora (1Hive's Aragon sidechain) will allow organizations to quickly and easily deploy Aragon DAOs with minimal costs. As organizations get familiar with Aragon they can, if they want, choose to upgrade to a more secure DAO on Ethereum's mainnet. This allows organizations to try out Aragon with minimal upfront costs, it improves the onboarding experience for that organization's community members, and it gives them full control over their experience - choosing the amount of security that is right for their use case. Just like burner wallets allow users to quickly and easily start using Ethereum, Flora allows organizations to quickly and easily try Aragon.

### Strategy, Aragon PMF, and Aragon GTM

Aragon wants to fund projects that increase the value of Aragon as a platform as well as ANT. Flora offers the ability to offer developers both fast and cheap Aragon DAOs as well as sovereign DAOs. This greatly expands the potential use cases for Aragon, allowing us to build more and attract more talent to the community. This will allow the NestDAO to fund more small scale bottom-up projects faster and cheaper than the current monolithic Flock proposals. This will increase the value of Aragon as a platform; positioning us to take control of expanding marketshare as the space develops. If successful, this will lead to more Aragon app developers, more/better apps, more value for Aragon as a platform, more funds to support development, more developers, etc...

### Sustainability

Unlike many projects with tokens, Flora's token actually has utility. It allows users to secure lower transaction fees, pay for transaction fees, and engage in network governance. This has the potential to create positive cash flows for 1Hive, allowing us to continue development and maintenance of the Flora sidechain long after any potential grant money is spent.
