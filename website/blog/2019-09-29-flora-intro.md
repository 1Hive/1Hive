## General Notes and Sketches

### Overview

Flora, a less decentralized but more efficient alternative to Ethereum mainnet

We believe that deploying an organization to Ethereum mainnet is a good option for a specific subset of organizations which want to interact with lots of external applications, or desire sovereign grade censorship resistance. However, we think that there is a strong case to be made that the vast majority of users who would benefit from Aragon do not need these features and would benefit greatly from deploying on a sidechain with less congestion, lower transaction fees, and faster confirmation times.

We will deploy and maintain a Proof of Authority sidechain similar to xDAI and deploy and maintain the core Aragon infrastructure there. This sidechain will also introduce a novel Discount Token mechanism based on research done by BlockScience.

The discount token model used on Flora will enable regular users to become co-owners and operators of the network and grant governance rights over the validator set. But more importantly, it will enable them to purchase and hold tokens to cover their usage and then not need to worry about the mental overhead of micro-transactions if they don’t want to. The discount token, Honey, will be issued by 1Hive’s Aragon organization on Ethereum mainnet and linked to ANT via Aragon Fundraising.

The Aragon community is talking about go-to-market strategies. Flora, a scalable Araogn sidechain could help a lot with this. If 1Hive rolls out the PoA sidechain, then Aragon will be able to offer sovereign censorship resistant DAOs and/or fast, cheap, and scalable DAOs. This means that we can attract developer talent for a wide range of use cases and it lowers the barrier to entry for new organizations.


### giving users the choice to iteratively upgrade their security

Just like burner wallet allows users to get started right away, and gradually increase their security, Flora (1Hive's Aragon sidechain) will allow organizations to quickly and easily deploy Aragon DAOs with minimal costs. Then, as they get familiar with the platform they can upgrade to mainnet if they want.

If the goal is an iterative security model that allows DAOs to choose the amount of security they want, then PoA works just fine. It also works now. Then as more options become available we can upgrade if that seems like something users want. Having an cheaper/faster alternative to the 100% trustless sovereign L1 Ethereum chain seems kind of essential if we want better ways to onboard users, and thus find product/market fit

Just like there needs be an easy way to start using Ethereum (burner wallets), there needs to be a fast and easy way for organizations to start exploring Aragon and onboarding their community (Flora)

### Strategy, Aragon PMF, and Aragon GTM

Soon the Aragon strategy NestDAO grants program will be aligned to fund projects that increase the value of Aragon as a platform as well as ANT. With the abilty to offer both fast and cheap Aragon DAOs as well as sovereign DAOs we will be able to attract more talent and have higher quality deal flow to the Nest program. This will allow the NestDAO to fund more small scale bottom-up projects faster and cheaper than the current monolithic Flock proposals.

This will position Aragon to completely crush the current DAO market as well as take control of expanding marketshare as the space develops. This will lead to more devs, more deal flow, better apps, more value, more funds to support development, more value, etc...

### Sustainability
- potential to generate positive cash flows
- the token actually has value and utility
